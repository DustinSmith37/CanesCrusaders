Cane’s Crusaders is a retro arcade game that joins 
Cane’s CEO Todd Graves on his journey to secure his 
restaurant’s name as the superior chicken selling restaurant. 
As the game continues on, you’ll see more recognizable 
chicken faces as Todd’s journey progresses. The game
implements a shop in-between levels to allow the
player to purchase upgrades and power-ups. This
project was inspired from the arcade game Galaga
and Space Invaders.
